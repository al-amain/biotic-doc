We like to hear you out when you get stuck or encounter difficulty with our products. As soon as you buy one of our products – you can open a support ticket and share your concern immediately.  Email: [hello@uilyn.com](https://app.gitbook.com/u/TTktuKQza1QW0RudmPKf8svEBd42)

## Support Policy:

It is recommended that before submitting a ticket you take a close look at product documentation (Docs folder in the archive you have downloaded from Themeforest/Codecanyon). You need a valid purchase code to get technical support and assistance. You will find this when you SignIn your Codecanyon/Themeforest “Download” page. Click on the product’s download link.

## **Please Note:**

Free support policy includes troubleshooting, technical assistance with the product only. It does not include any customization, additional features integration or concerns about third-party plugins compatibility. But, support is applied to plugin(s) we have developed and integrated ourselves. We appreciate your understanding!

You can expect answer within 24-48 hours, usually as soon as possible in the order they were received.

All support requests are being processed on business days (Monday to Friday) from 10:00 to 18:00 (GMT +05.30). We are in GMT+5:30 time zone. We address all the support queries 5 days weekly on the first-come, first-solve basis (Saturday, Sundays off).
